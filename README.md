## This is my second CodeReview Project.

- You will find my finished Site in Master Branch

- I decided to make the footer fixed, because i think it looks better overall :)

- I was not quite sure if the article page should be a template site where each article site will be displayed later on or if its a page where all articles are linked, anyways I included it in the Navbar under the name "News".
