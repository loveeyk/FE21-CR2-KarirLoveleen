## This is my second CodeReview Project.

- You will find my finished Site in Master Branch

- I decided to make the footer fixed, because i think it looks better overall :)

- For me the exercise instruction was a bit "unclear". I was not quite sure if the article page should be a template site where each article  will be displayed later on (which makes including it in the navbar unnecessary) or if its a page where all article thumbnails are presented. anyways I included it in the Navbar under the name "News".
